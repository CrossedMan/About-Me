# Hello
My first repository (updated)

A little bit about me.

I currently live in Michigan as a Marine Corps Recruiter. My career is based on logistics but I have a passion for computers and have aspirations to create my own game even if it's just a platform scroller. In the past I've studied: HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I stopped years ago. I feel like I failed to excel in those because I have no desire to create websites nor do I have to creativity to do so. I'm now focused on Python. Working my way up to the ultimate goal.

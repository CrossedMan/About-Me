My first repository

A little bit about me.

I currently live in North Carolina. I'm a US Marine with aspirations to become a web-developer/programmer. I've been studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript for about a year but not consistantly due to work. I fairly fluent in HTML and CSS but I struggle with JavaScript. I feel like my ability to excel is my lack of creativity. I would love to test and perfect my skills by creating something like a small website but I just don't know what to put content wise.
